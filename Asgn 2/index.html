        <p>“Snowman” was released as the second single off Sia’s first Christmas album, Everyday Is Christmas. In this down-tempo love song, Sia confesses her love to her snowman, a metaphor for the man she loves. Like most of the songs on the album, “Snowman” is written by both Sia and Greg Kurstin.</p>

        <p><i>[Verse 1]</i><br><br>
            Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me <br>
            Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling?<br>
            If you can't catch me, darling<br>
            Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way<br>
            A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby<br>
            Can't hold me close, baby<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Chorus]</i><br><br>
            I want you to know that I'm never leaving<br>
            'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing<br>
            Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons<br>
            So come on, let's go<br>
            Let's go below zero and hide from the sun<br>
            I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun<br>
            Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily<br>
            Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Post-Chorus]</i><br><br>
            My snowman and me, eh<br>
            My snowman and me<br>
            Baby<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse 2]</i><br><br>
            Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun<br>
            Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?<br>
            Without legs to run, honey<br>
            Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear<br>
            Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?<br>
            If you don't have ears, baby<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Chorus]</i><br><br>
            I want you to know that I'm never leaving<br>
            'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing<br>
            Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons<br>
            So come on, let's go<br>
            Let's go below zero and hide from the sun<br>
            I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun<br>
            Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily<br>
            Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Post-Chorus]</i><br><br>
            My snowman and me, eh<br>
            My snowman and me<br>
            Baby<br></p>
